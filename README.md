# Rabbit-Clone

## Project Summary - 
This project is a clone of Rabbit, an ios app that allowed users to watch things like netflix, hulu, etc. with friends and family realtime. In my version of this clone you're able to log in and watch synchronized youtube videos with other users.

## Motivation -
Because of coronavirus, it has been harder to keep in touch with peers, and I wanted to create something interactive that I could use with them and have fun with. When a youtube livestream is going on or there's a new video out I want to watch with my friends, instead of having to time up exactly when we're going to press play, who's leaving and pause, etc. this application takes care of all of that. In the future im looking into adding a chat feature so you can communicate with who you're watching with, without having to know who they are beforehand or communicate using another means (i.e. discord, zoom).
